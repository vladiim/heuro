* The internet has up-ended the core dimension of business competition

* Companies used to win by mastering distribution - the act of physically making a product available

* The internet has made distribution a non-event, especially for digital goods where it's free

* Transaction costs are now also essentially zero - eCommerce vs many stores

* These mechanisms have moved the basis for business competition from distribution to user/customer retention

* To win in this new dimension of competition businesses need customer loyalty

* There are three core drivers of loyalty (a) having a good product, (b) being in a loyal category (replacement razors, Nespresso), (c) designed loyalty programs

* Loyalty programs are therefore increasingly critical to be a successful modern business

* The core loyalty program categories include (a) transactional - buy stuff, get more stuff for less (b) experiential - buy stuff, get access to interesting stuff, (c) fundamental - access our products and services easier through our loyalty program

* Transactional examples: Sophora, AMEX, Coles Flybuys, Qantas Frequent Flyer

* Experiential examples: Nordstrom, The North Face VIPeak Rewards, Audi

* Fundamental examples: Starbucks, Disney MagicBand, Bonobos (or any Digitally Native Vertical Brand), Nike Plus

* People are bombarded with loyalty card offers and messaging and need value beyond a transaction - buy our stuff and we'll give you more stuff

* Loyalty programs are increasingly me too and people are bored of it

* The businesses that create sustainable competitive advantages via loyalty programs will do so via fundamental programs

* Fundamental loyalty strategies don't look like a traditional "loyalty program" look at the examples given above, these guys have woven their loyalty programs into the fabric of their business

* These next-level loyalty programs require their own value proposition which is deeply entrenched in the businesses' values, and that align with something the businesses' highest value customers care about

* They are a product/service in their own right

* Fundamental loyalty programs can therefore be thought of as a glue that sit above a brand's product/service that drives competitive advantage through user/customer retention
