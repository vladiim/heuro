### Tesla's true competitive advantage, brand

When journalists and pundits try to evaluate Tesla's potential by comparing their product with other Electric Vehicles (EVs) they miss the point completely. Tesla's biggest competitive advantage is not their product's feature set, high-tech production facilities, lack of dealership channel or intuitive software. Tesla's true competitive advantage is their brand.

By focusing on the high-end market and initially appealing to Silicon Valley CEOs and Venture Capitalists as their first customer segment, Tesla has positioned themselves as the epitome of Silicon Valley prestige. They hold the promise of everything the modern economy aspires to - the successful startup. This promise, the promise of success, is the ultimate luxury. And when they offered this promise for $35,000 USD over 300,000 people rushed to pre-order a product that best represents modern success.

Now Tesla is facing the same challenge as every successful Kickstarter maker. Filling a shit tone of orders. In their latest shareholder report they announced that they missed their Q1 2016 delivery expectations by ~7.5% and that's only on 16,000 orders. The same amount on their Series 3 pre-sales equates to 22,500 missed orders. If they don't deliver and over deliver they could see a sharp turn in the brand perception that's given them so much.

_<strong>Strategy</strong>_

In 2011, online flash sales retailer Fab reached one million users just five months after launch.

_<strong>Trends</strong>_

Our current version of the internet lives and breaths off a currency of human attention. With the success and failure of many internet companies predicated on how much of a person’s time they can capture.

Because of this modern businesses aren’t creating human-centered experiences, they're creating attention-centered experiences, which puts the needs of the business squarely ahead of the needs of the customer.

_<strong>Marketing</strong>_

Moving from the 4P’s and a limited marketing mix to managing an infinite numbers of digital channels, an ever-growing and always-on customer base, and a global organization, created a seemingly exponential amount of new work and data points for modern marketers to contend with. All the while, as the complexity grew, so too did the demand for efficiency as software drove transparency across the broader organization.
