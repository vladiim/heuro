## Feedback

{% image science_advertising/validation_board.png %}

<blockquote>Some advertising men go out in person and sell to people before they plan to write an ad. One of the ablest of them has spent weeks on one article, selling from house to house. In this way they learn the reactions from different forms of argument and approach. They learn what possible buyers want and the factors which don't appeal. It is quite customary to interview hundreds of possible customers.</blockquote>

The larger and more diverse and independent your feedback, the more accurate it will be. Such was James Surowiecki's argument in [The Wisdom of Crowds][wisdom-crowds]. In order to engage with customers you need to "get out of the building." This term was first coined by [Steve Blank][sblank] in [The Four Steps to the Epiphany][4steps] and was an insightful acknowledgment that software is built for people. If you don't take the time to understand what people want, your software will be useless.

Blank's former student, [Eric Ries][eries] built on Blank's work with [The Lean Startup][leansu]. Within the lean startup, product development cycles are shortened through "iterative learning" a process whereby product development is tested incrementally and iteratively with customers in the real world.

**Next step:** use and understand the customer development [Validation Board][valboard]. This useful poster and methodology will help you understand and implement customer validation in your marketing.

## Understand the job to be done

{% image science_advertising/jtbd_timeline.png %}

<blockquote>There is nearly always something impressive which others have not told. We must discover it. We must have a seeming advantage. People don't quit habits without reason.</blockquote>

Hopkins' focus above is on an advertising message but it can easily be interpreted as "understand the unique motivator people really want." Changing people's behaviour, getting them to purchase your product, is hard. To do so your product needs to be positioned to solve a true need they have.

Too many products are released to the world and fall flat because their positioning is fundamentally incorrect. They are designed by internal committee and solving a problem no one has.

In order to marry product development with customer needs Clayton Christensen developed the [jobs-to-be-done][jtbd-article] framework. Jobs-to-be-done is designed to uncover the causal mechanism behind a purchase. It explains why chocolates and flowers compete with each other during Valentine's Day - they are both being hired to show affection. By understanding the causal driver behind a purchase decision you fundamentally change your product development prioritisation, market placement, messaging and design.

**Next step:** learn the jobs-to-be-done framework from [jobstobedone.org][jtbd-org]. The site, blog, podcast and resources have built on Christensen's original work to form a robust methodology. They even have an [online course][jtbd-mooc].

## Optimise towards a metric

<blockquote>Scientific advertising is impossible without [knowing your results]. So is safe advertising. So is maximum profit. Groping in the dark in this field has probably cost enough money to pay the national debt.</blockquote>

## Position based on the job

"[Vaseline] established a new demand, then almost monopolized that demand through wisdom at the start. To have called it some different brand of petroleum jelly might have made a difference of millions in results."

microsoft lost smartphone b/c they were trying to make a dumb computer, apple made a smart phone

## advertising is sales

"The only purpose of advertising is to make sales. It is profitable or unprofitable according to its actual sales. It is not for general effect. It is not to keep you name before the people. It is not primarily to aid you other salesmen. Treat it as a salesman. Force it to justify itself. Compare it with other salesmen. Figure its cost and result. Accept no excuses which good salesmen do not make. Then you will not go far wrong."

"Ads are not written to entertain. When they do, those entertainment seekers are little likely to be the people whom you want. That is one of the greatest advertising faults. Ad writers abandon their parts. They forget they are salesmen and try to be performers. Instead of sales, they seek applause."



"The reason for most of the non-successes in advertising is trying to sell people what they do not want. But next to that comes lack of true salesmanship."

## service

- show google voice ads as e.g.

- also show success of freemium model, evernote cohort, spotify etc

"Remember the people you address are selfish, as we all are. They care nothing about your interests or profit. They seek service for themselves. Ignoring this fact is a common mistake and a costly mistake in advertising."

"The best ads ask no one to buy. That is useless. Often they do not quote a price. They do not say that dealers handle the product. The ads are based entirely on service. They offer wanted information."

## mail order ads

1st version of a/b testing

"A large percentage of people who read an ad and decide to act will forget that decision in five minutes."

recommend insert coupons to cut out, CTA, investment from hooked

***

## headlines

"The story in these ads are nearly identical. But the returns vary enormously, due to the headlines."

"If we are using twenty magazines we may use twenty separate ads."

***

## psychology

"Human nature is perpetual. So the principles of psychology are fixed and enduring."

***

## tell your full story

"Any reader of your ad is interested, else he would not be a reader. You are dealing with someone willing to listen. Then do your level best. That reader, if you lose him now, may never again be a reader."

onboarding - twitter, so many people that signed up and never again used the service

***

"However expensive, [samples] usually form the cheapest selling method."

freemium, evernote cohort, spotify egs

"Almost any questions can be answered, cheaply, quickly and finally, but a test campaign. And that's the way to answer them - not by arguments around a table."

"In five years for one food advertiser we tried out over fifty separate plans. Every little while we found an improvement, so the results of our advertising constantly grew. At the end of five years we found the best plan of all. It reduced our cost of selling by 75 percent."
