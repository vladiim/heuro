They're tuning in to watch videos that inspire, educate, or entertain. They're loyal, passionate, and highly engaged, powering a 280% growth in food channel subscriptions over the past year.

Sixty-nine percent of these highly engaged moms watch food videos every week, and 68% of them will also watch videos while cooking.6

Millennial women tend to cook for social occasions rather than regular meals, seeking inspiration from baking and appetizer videos.

3. Millennials are the generation least informed about the news
Millennials performed the poorest in a recent Pew Research Center study of the public's knowledge of current events. They averaged 7.8 questions right on a 12-question news quiz, less than every other age group: http://www.people-press.org/2015/04/28/what-the-public-knows-in-pictures-words-maps-and-graphs/

4. Millennials are the nation's leading vaccine skeptics

5. Millennials care less about free speech than other generations
Just yesterday I reported on a Pew survey showing that 18- to 29-year-olds were the generation least likely to say it's okay for news outlets to publish cartoons of the prophet Muhammad. http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/05/04/americans-overwhelmingly-support-muhammad-cartoonists-right-to-offend/

I recently turned 25 and I am failing at being an adult. I don’t see myself buying a house anytime soon or investing in property. I don’t want to have kids any time soon because I honestly don’t know how I afford to feed myself half the time, let alone a child. And the only person I want to marry is the barista at the cafe by my house, but I haven’t even told him my name.

Traditionally, by 25 we are expected to have accomplished, or at least gotten close to accomplishing, five pillars of “adulthood”: having children, graduating from college, getting married, finding a career and buying a home. It’s no wonder that, since turning 25, I find myself having daily anxieties about not being the kind of adult my parents or grandparents were.

As shown in Figure 1, just over half have visited a doctor’s office in the past year, compared to nearly three-quarters of non-Millennials. By contrast, Millennials are more likely to have utilized a range of care options, from urgent-care clinics to emergency rooms to home remedies. Much of the stigma around alternative health care facilities seems to be gone; indeed, almost as many agree (31 percent) as disagree (33 percent) that care from a clinic is as good as that from a doctor’s office.

The Internet has undeniably become a top tool in Millennials’ DIY health care arsenal, allowing them to learn from the experiences of experts and fellow patients alike as they research symptoms, conditions, treatments, providers and facilities. The idea that Millennials rely on “Dr. Google” is not an exaggeration but it’s important to recognize that they are using Internet resources as both an alternative and a complement to traditional medical care – a way to prepare for going to the doctor or to avoid having to go as often.

The trend towards self-quantification, enabled by wearable devices and health apps, has also transformed the ability of patients to monitor and improve their own health. In our study, adoption rates among Millennials were still relatively low (27 percent app, 8 percent wearable) but far outpaced older generations (12 percent, 4 percent). When we asked what they’d like to see from their tech-health tools in the future, the central theme was towards centralization – on both a private level, aggregating an individual or family’s medical data in a single, secure location; and a public level, integrating self-generated health data with a range of providers, insurers, brands and the larger electronic health record system.

Millennials are known for their YOLO (“you only live once”) attitude and this is generally true of their health care behaviors as well. While consumers across generations agreed on the importance of daily stay-healthy steps like drinking enough water, getting enough sleep and exercising, there was less consensus around future-focused behaviors (Figure 2). Perhaps surprisingly, less than half of Millennials consider getting regular medical (44 percent) and dental (45 percent) checkups or having health insurance (46 percent) to be part of maintaining their overall health and wellness; nor are they too interested in getting vaccinations (39 percent), performing routine self-exams (32 percent) or getting routine cancer screenings (23 percent).

For example, nearly half of Millennials consider maintaining a work/life balance (49 percent) and relationships with friends and family (47 percent) to be part of their health and wellness. Note that these are larger proportions than chose any of the above institution-centric behaviors. More than a quarter say organic, natural and non-toxic products are part of maintaining their health and may see them as alternatives to traditional medicine, signaling an opportunity for brands well beyond the traditional health care sectors.

Millennials have been dubbed the “most stressed” generation in history,3 so it’s no surprise that they recognize the importance of relaxation and mental health in maintaining long-term health; in fact, 55 percent agree that a healthy mind leads to a healthy body, not the other way around. As a result, they are more likely than non-Millennials to consider unplugging from technology, meditation, massage and talk therapy to be elements of staying well.

Percent of Millennials who… 
Say keeping up with the news is at least somewhat important to them 85%
Get news daily  69%
Regularly follow five or more "hard news" topics  45%
Usually see diverse opinions through social media 86%
Pay for at least one news-specific service, app, or digital subscription  40%

This generation tends not to consume news in discrete sessions or by going directly to news providers. Instead, news and information are woven into an often continuous but mindful way that Millennials connect to the world generally, which mixes news with social connection, problem solving, social action, and entertainment.

Virtually all Millennials, for instance, regularly consume a mix of hard news, lifestyle news, and practical “news you can use,” the study finds. Millennials are more likely to report following politics, crime, technology, their local community, and social issues than report following popular culture and celebrities, or style and fashion. Fully 45 percent of these young adults regularly follow five or more “hard news” topics.

Forrester defines Millennials as US consumers ages 18 to 34. Online Millennials make up more than 69
million consumers, a third of the US online adult population. These consumers have fully embedded
technology in their personal and professional lives — in fact, in many cases, technology defines their being.
Analyzing Forrester’s Consumer Technographics survey data, we see that (see Figure 1):

There are two distinct groups of Millennials at different life stages. Although consumers born in
the 1980s and mid-1990s are generally referred to as Millennials, we see two distinct groups within
this larger population: younger Millennials (ages 18 to 24) and older Millennials (ages 25 to 34). While
both groups love technology, they have major differences: Older Millennials are more than twice as
likely to be employed full time, they spend more than twice as much online, and they’re much more
likely to be married and have higher incomes than younger Millennials.

■ Older Millennials have the highest expectations of companies. Millennials, and especially older
Millennials, are a prime target for companies — they love technology and they love to interact with
brands they like. They are also the age group most likely to agree that they would pay more for
products that save them time and hassle. However, they are not an easy target group to please, with
higher expectations than any other age group. Because their device of choice is their smartphone, 
For Marketing Leadership Professionals almost half of older Millennials expect companies to have a mobile app, more than six in 10
expect companies to have mobile-friendly websites, and more than half feel frustrated and
annoyed when they encounter a website that’s not mobile-friendly. And they let others know
when they are disappointed — they’re the age group most likely to write negative reviews and
post online if they are dissatisfied.

Generations, like people, have personalities, and Millennials — the American teens and twenty-somethings who are making the passage into adulthood at the start of a new millennium — have begun to forge theirs: confident, self-expressive, liberal, upbeat and open to change.

They are more ethnically and racially diverse than older adults. They’re less religious, less likely to have served in the military, and are on track to become the most educated generation in American history.

Only about six-in-ten were raised by both parents — a smaller share than was the case with older generations.

Spanning a cohort born between 1980 to 2000, millennials broadly make up one of the largest generations in history (bigger than the baby boom generation). Millennials are also investing, lending and sharing money much differently than their parents, and they are assisted by a growing set of tech-driven tools to do so.

One of the largest generations in history is about to move into its prime spending years. Millennials are poised to reshape the economy; their unique experiences will change the ways we buy and sell, forcing companies to examine how they do business for decades to come.

THE FIRST DIGITAL NATIVES
Millennials have grown up with the internet and smartphones in an always-on digital world.


"After searching online, how do you communicate with others about a service, product, or a brand?"

* 44% sms

* 38% social

* 38% IM

* 16% blog

Student loan payments are taking up a growing chunk of postgraduate Millennials' income.

With less to spend, they're putting off commitments like marriage and home ownerships.

A growing number of Millennials are choosing to live at home with their parents.

Millennials have been putting off significant milestones like marriage and children. But that doesn’t mean they want to stay single forever.

ACCESS, NOT OWNERSHIP
It’s not just homes: Millennials have been reluctant to buy items such as cars, music and luxury goods. Instead, they’re turning to a new set of services that provide access to products without the burdens of ownership, giving rise to what's being called a "sharing economy."

If brands are shrinking in importance, social media is growing. Millennials are turning to their online networks when making purchasing decisions.

for millennials, wellness is a daily, active pursuit. They’re exercising more, eating smarter and smoking less than previous generations. They’re using apps to track training data, and online information to find the healthiest foods. And this is one space where they’re willing to spend money on compelling brands.

For Millennials, “healthy” doesn’t just mean “not sick.” It’s a daily commitment to eating right and exercising.

The Millennial generation is the largest in US history and as they reach their prime working and spending years, their impact on the economy is going to be huge.

Millennials have come of age during a time of technological change, globalization and economic disruption. That’s given them a different set of behaviors and experiences than their parents.

They have been slower to marry and move out on their own, and have shown different attitudes to ownership that have helped spawn what’s being called a “sharing economy.”

They’re also the first generation of digital natives, and their affinity for technology helps shape how they shop. They are used to instant access to price comparisons, product information and peer reviews.

Finally, they are dedicated to wellness, devoting time and money to exercising and eating right. Their active lifestyle influences trends in everything from food and drink to fashion.

These are just some of the trends that will shape the new Millennial economy.
