what startups can learn from scientific advertising
startup marketing lessons from ...

Claude Hopkins was responsible for marketing innovations such as split testing and coupons. In 1923 he wrote the hugely influential [Scientific Advertising][sci-ad-book] which still bears lessons for today's marketers. In this post we'll go through the lessons startup marketer's can glean from Scientific Advertising.

## Understand the job to be done

{% image science_advertising/jtbd_timeline.png %}

<blockquote>There is nearly always something impressive which others have not told. We must discover it. We must have a seeming advantage. People don't quit habits without reason.</blockquote>

Hopkins' focus above is on an advertising message but it can easily be interpreted as "understand the unique motivator people really want." Changing people's behaviour, getting them to purchase your product, is hard. To do so your product needs to be positioned to solve a true need they have.

Too many products are released to the world and fall flat because their positioning is fundamentally incorrect. They are designed by internal committee and solving a problem no one has.

<blockquote>The reason for most of the non-successes in advertising is trying to sell people what they do not want.</blockquote>

In order to marry product development with customer needs Clayton Christensen developed the [jobs-to-be-done][jtbd-article] framework. Jobs-to-be-done is designed to uncover the causal mechanism behind a purchase. It explains why chocolates and flowers compete with each other during Valentine's Day - they are both being hired to show affection. By understanding the causal driver behind a purchase decision you fundamentally change your product development prioritisation, market placement, messaging and design.

**First steps:** learn the jobs-to-be-done framework from [jobstobedone.org][jtbd-org]. The site, blog, podcast and resources have built on Christensen's original work to form a robust methodology. They even have an [online course][jtbd-mooc].

## Seek customer feedback

{% image science_advertising/validation_board.png %}

<blockquote>Some advertising men go out in person and sell to people before they plan to write an ad. One of the ablest of them has spent weeks on one article, selling from house to house. In this way they learn the reactions from different forms of argument and approach. They learn what possible buyers want and the factors which don't appeal. It is quite customary to interview hundreds of possible customers.</blockquote>

The larger and more diverse and independent your feedback, the more accurate it will be. Such was James Surowiecki's argument in [The Wisdom of Crowds][wisdom-crowds]. In order to engage with customers you need to "get out of the building." This term was first coined by [Steve Blank][sblank] in [The Four Steps to the Epiphany][4steps] and was an insightful acknowledgment that software is built for people. If you don't take the time to understand what people want, your software will be useless.

Blank's former student, [Eric Ries][eries] built on Blank's work with [The Lean Startup][leansu]. Within the lean startup, product development cycles are shortened through "iterative learning" a process whereby product development is tested incrementally and iteratively with customers in the real world.

**First steps:** use and understand the customer development [Validation Board][valboard]. This useful poster and methodology will help you understand and implement customer validation in your marketing.

## Optimise based on outcomes

<blockquote>Scientific advertising is impossible without [knowing your results]. So is safe advertising. So is maximum profit. Groping in the dark in this field has probably cost enough money to pay the national debt.</blockquote>

In order to systematically improve marketing results it's critical to optimise towards a set of metrics that enable you to understand your marketing drivers. In [Lean Analytics][lean-analytics] a good metric is defined as being:

* **Comparative:** you want to compare the metric by different dimensions such as time or user segments

* **Understandable:** a good metric is intuitive and easily discussed such as a customer's lifetime value, the cost to acquire a customer or the monthly customer churn rate

* **A ratio or rate:** it's much more helpful to know the customers churning per month over several years rather than the total number of customers that have churned, ratios give you insight into velocity and are inherently comparative.

Most importantly, good metrics enable you to change how you behave. There's no point measuring something unless it's going to drive your behaviour.

In order to help focus startups on behaviour driving metrics, 500 Startups founder [Dave McClure][dm] created a presentation and framework called [Startup Metrics for Pirates][pirates]. Within the framework McClure breaks down the customer lifecycle across acquisition, activation, retention, referral and revenue categories and recommends behaviour-driving metrics be placed into each of the categories.

**First steps:** understand the principals in [Lean Analytics][lean-analytics] and [Startup Metrics for Pirates][pirates]. Identify the critical metrics to drive your marketing programme. Automate the consolidation and reporting of your datasets (website, channel reach, sales etc).

## Continually test in market

<blockquote>Almost any questions can be answered, cheaply, quickly and finally, but a test campaign. And that's the way to answer them - not by arguments around a table.</blockquote>

In Hopkins' time a marketing test would involve laboriously coding coupons or testing a message in a specific region and analysing sales impact. Today, digital mediums make it negligible to test creative variations whether they be through your website, emails, social posts or advertising buys.

Behemoths like Amazon are famous for continually testing variations on their site. In [one famous example][amazon-billion] Amazon was able to increase revenue by $2.7 billion a year based on a simple tweak to their review interface.

**First steps:** understand the basic capabilities and processes of multivariate tools like [Optimizely][optimizly] or [Website Optimizer][wso]. Then begin to roll out multivariate tests:

* Using your behaviour-driving metrics (read above), identify a metric you'd like to influence such as sign up conversions (activation)

* Identify a portion of your business that can influence the metric such as a sign up page

* Hypothesis how the current page needs to change in order to drive an increase in conversion rates, for example, add social sign up

* Implement your test with an multivariate testing tool like [Optimizely][optimizly] or [Website Optimizer][wso]

* Determine the winner, you want confidence that test results aren't by chance. Confidence in a test is a function of sample size and variation in results. You can use the [Chi Squared][chi-squared] test to determine confidence levels and the margin of error. If these don't overlap i.e. the original page converts at 20-26% and the test converts at 30-35% then one
