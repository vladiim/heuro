I'm trying a new email format after several people gave me great feedback. Let me know your thoughts.

**Musings** our economy is in the nascent phase of using data to drive business behaviour. As the technologies and practices to collect, value and distribute data are refined we will potentially see a raft of new businesses emerge. What businesses will be born to integrate and make sense of various disparate data sources? Will we have insight marketplaces that collate and resell anonymized data from companies and individuals? How will privacy be managed when the most intimate details of where we go, what we buy and who we talk to are all connected?

## Channels

#### [The eyeballs business has a big mobile challenge][mobileeye]

Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook COO continually argues there's a disconnect between the percentage of time people spend on Facebook and the percentage of money advertisers allocate to the platform. Funnily enough, it's the same argument Yahoo made in the 2000's about all of digital advertising.

#### [The future of advertising has been around forever][futuread]

The new crop of effective advertising will be akin to something we’re already used to — testimonials. Right now, the business model for online publishers is at odds with those same publishers being able to keep their customers happy. Programmatic advertisements are slowing down users’ experiences on the Internet, particularly on the mobile web.
