### 1. [Diamonds are bullshit][diamondsbs]
_<strong>Strategy</strong>_

_<strong>Growth</strong>_

Great summary from Uber's head of Growth. The key outtake:

* Growth is not a bunch of small, tactical growth hacks

* It is a full model and system with linked parts and loops that align with your business

* Tactics can be used to optimize loops, but the entire model must be well understood first.

In addition to the video content and inventory on Facebook and Instagram, brands buying Anthology deals also get anonymized audience insights from Facebook, such as the interests of their target consumers according to their Facebook profiles, the types of things they talk about on Facebook and how they compare by location.

### 8. [Super Bowl ads almost overrun the viral video chart][superbowlad]

If it weren't for a Facebook campaign and Sam's Club "big game" campaign, the Viral Video Chart for the week ending Super Bowl Sunday would have been all campaigns built around in-game spots.
