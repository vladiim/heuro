# Marketing naivete

Mark Twain once said, "to succeed in life, you need two things: ignorance and confidence." By its nature, an innovation happens when someone applies a fresh approach to a problem. Incumbent businesses and executives often approach problems based on what's failed in the past rather than what's possible in the future. And trait ensures a future of mediocrity.

The issue is, our past experience drives our thinking. We feel pain when remembering failures of old. Being naive is hard when we've got baggage. The only sure-fire way for senior marketers to consistently gain the benefits from a naive point of view is customer obsession.

"The key to success for most brands is to shift the focus from channels and technologies to the human behavior and becoming customer obsessed, both in strategy and execution" - [reference][ref].

_<strong>Trends</strong>_

Mobile search is a real problem for Google: people don’t do it nearly as much as you suspect it would like. But there’s no obvious way of changing that behaviour while users are so addicted to apps on their phones.
