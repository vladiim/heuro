### Musings

Is digital advertising a joke? It certainly seems to be the case based on a confluence of conversations currently going on over the interwebs. Apple announced they will [help block ads with iOS 9][adblack9]. There is [rampant fraud across the digital ad industry][fraud2] to the tune of [$75 billion][adfraud]. People are increasingly sick of their web experience sucking [due to heavy ad servers][websucks]. But publishers need to [make money somehow][contentmon] and traditionally that was through advertising. So what's the answer? Will BuzzFeed's evolution of the advertorial be adopted by other publishers? Will publishers use their content to launch or new ad products e.g. Fairfax with Drive, MyCareer and Domain? Will the new golden child, [native social ads][nativedarling], fall pray to the [law of shitty clickthroughs][shiteclick]?

<small>Trends</small>
When Apple’s iOS 9 comes out in September, there’s going to be a dramatic uptake of ad blockers on iOS – and it’s going to have far-reaching effects not just on websites and advertisers, but potentially also on the balance in mobile platforms and even on Google’s revenues.

<small>Customer obsessed</small>
Digitarians will not shape the internet, because that has already been done. What they will do is adopt and demand better technology like self driving cars, embeddable devices, and interfaces controlled by gestures.

An argument that for there to be quality content on the web, we need the kind of disruption that the iTunes Music Store had on music or Netflix on movies.

### [Is Facebook lying about video views?][fbvideo]
<small>Channels</small>
YouTube has been vague about how they count a view, but they’ve said that it’s counted after “about 30 seconds.” Facebook on the other hand is explicit, they count it as a view after three seconds of a silent, auto-played video. Facebook drop off rate looks to be far higher than YouTube's.
