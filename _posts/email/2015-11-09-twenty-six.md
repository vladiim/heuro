## When qual misses the point

[Our brain is primed to reach false conclusions][brain]. Psychologists have a name for the cognitive bias that makes us prone to assigning a causal relationship to two events simply because they happened one after the other: the “illusion of causality.”

Case in point - in a [ground-breaking piece of research][panty], Nisbett and Wilson asked women to choose the most one of four pantyhose. When asked why they made their decision they gave all manner of reasons strength, elasticity etc. The issue is all four pairs were identical.

Marketers will often use qualitative research to help us understand the causal mechanisms behind consumer behavior. Why did they buy one product over the other? What elements influenced their descision? The issue is, much of this research is based on the customer's illusion of causality. Very few, if any humans truly understand their decision-making process so the research is fundamentally wrong.

So what are we to do? We need to...

* Acknowledge that research that asks people to describe their descision-making is fundamentally flawed

* Rely far more heavily on in-market research such as multivariate tests to guide our insights

* Investigate alternative qualitative methodologies such as [Jobs To Be Done][jtbd] to uncover behavior motivations and triggers.

Do a quick search for product marketing on AngelList and you'll find over 800 startups looking for product marketers.

### 3. [Your LTV (customer lifetime value) math is wrong][ltv]
_<strong>Data informed</strong>_

There has been a lot of good stuff written over the years on the topic of calculating customer lifetime value (LTV). The top three reasons many investors roll their eyes when they see entrepreneurs present inflated, poorly constructed LTVs are:

1. Understated churn rates

2. Low cost of capital

3. Incorrect gross margin.

_<strong>Customer obsessed</strong>_

Nudges, small design changes that can markedly affect individual behavior, have been catching on. These techniques rely on insights from behavioral science, and when used ethically, they can be very helpful. But we need to be sure that they aren’t being employed to sway people to make bad decisions that they will later regret.
