### 1. [Brands are behaving like organized religions][brandreligion]
_<strong>Brand</strong>_

Scholars have found that every organized religion offers three key benefits to its followers, a) a set of core beliefs and values, b) symbols, myths, and rituals, and c) relationships with members of a like-minded community. Given its influence on human behaviour, it's not surprising that savvy marketers have adapted some of the fundamental principals behind religions to sell influence people.

### 2. [Every company needs a growth manager][growthmanager]
_<strong>Growth</strong>_

The Growth Manager role remains poorly understood, especially outside Silicon Valley. As part of an entrepreneurial research effort, Harvard Business School interviewed more than a dozen Growth Managers at fast-growing startups and explored what they are doing to design a growth function within an organization.

### 3. [Instagram ads: too much?][instad]
_<strong>Trends</strong>_

Instagram is starting to feel less authentic and instead more like a giant marketing platform, where the very atom of a social network — a person — is the last thing to factor into experience and other decisions. The latest onslaught of ads is a far cry from the seamless and high-quality native-advertising experience promised by co-founder Kevin Systrom when the company launched its initial advertising experiments.

_<strong>Trends</strong>_

The computing industry progresses in two mostly independent cycles: financial and product cycles. Regardless, the future is coming: markets go up and down, and excitement ebbs and flows, but computing technology marches steadily forward.

### 5. [The new web typography][webtype]
_<strong>Design</strong>_

Typography might be a science but it has no guiding light, no Principia Mathematica, no Origin of Species—there are simply too many variables, and too many problems, to list the answers themselves. In this essay the author explores celebrating a new form of typography where we strive to navigate the instability between reader and text. The fitting analogy used is building castles out of sand.

### 6. [Blockchain is going to hit the media industry hard, just like the Internet][blockmedia]
_<strong>Trends</strong>_

The blockchain enables new ways to think about the value exchange between creators, middlemen and consumers. And it seems that media companies are sleepwalking into this next technology maelstrom, without knowing what’s going to hit them. Just like with the Internet.

4. Employ the vernacular.
