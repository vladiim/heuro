### 1. [Digitally native vertical brands][diginative]
_<strong>Brand</strong>_

A digitally-native vertical brand meets four criteria:

1. It’s primary means of interacting, transacting, and story-telling to consumers is via the web

2. It's a brand, and that brand is vertical

3. The DNVB is usually maniacally focused on customer experience and on customer intimacy

4. While born digitally, the brand rarely ends up digital only.

### 4. [Creatives, designers and drugs: what are they on, and why?][creativedrug]
_<strong>Trends</strong>_

“For art to exist, for any sort of aesthetic activity to exist, a certain physiological precondition is indispensable: intoxication,” said Nietzsche in 1889’s Twilight of the Idols.

There’s a long and clichéd lineage of creative drug-users that bears no repeating. But in today’s creative world, are people still looking to higher consciousness to inform their work? Or are they too busy scrolling through Tame Impala album artwork on Instagram to bother with lysergic or opiate matters? Are young people just plain sensible now?

### 5. [How the content explosion will invert the media industry][contentinvert]
_<strong>Trend</strong>_

Over the past century, technological advancements have massively reduced the cost and time needed to create and circulate content. Though this has liberated artists, consumers are now drowning in a virtually infinite supply of things to watch, listen to and read. The answer to a world where attention is the key constraint, not capital or distribution, isn’t Big Media – it’s the Influencer Curator.

### 6. [How IDEO designers persuade companies to accept change][ideopersuade]
_<strong>Customer obsessed</strong>_

IDEO uses "transformative empathy" to help sell disruptive ideas to its clients. When their stakeholders are having trouble imagining things being different than they are, or when they are extremely removed from (and even judgmental of) their customers, the experience of being wholly immersed in somebody else’s perspective can free up their thinking. The desired outcome is that stakeholders come away from the experience in agreement about the challenge being solved and with a felt understanding of why things need to change.

_<strong>Channel trend</strong>_

The advertising model for how to pay for just about every service online is flawed, cumbersome, invasive and unsustainable over the long run.

### 8. [Facebook has destroyed the open web][fbopen]
_<strong>Trends</strong>_

Facebook is killing links (and the web) because they are creating a space that is more like the future of television rather than the internet. It's a comfortable, safe place for users but there's a payoff.

### 9. [Do customers benefit from highly targeted online ads?][benfitonline]
_<strong>Channel</strong>_

Now a new paper from Stanford Graduate School of Business sheds light on who is likely to benefit from personalised advertising. The researchers found that highly targeted and personalised ads may not translate to higher profits for companies. They found that the most personalised ads were less effective because consumers worried they were being exploited.
