### Attention markets

In a [must listen podcast of exponent][exponent] the hosts frame the idea of "the attention market."

* Text (editorial) on the internet has been commoditized

* It's therefore increasingly difficult to make money from

* However, it's also exponentially more shareable

* Therefore, text on the internet is an incredibly viable marketing vehicle

* Publishers should therefore see text as a marketing tool rather than a revenue stream

* Revenue streams demand attention that text on the internet simply can't (hence "attention markets"), podcasts, real estate listing sites etc

* Text should therefore be used to drive people into the funnel and ultimately to a revenue generating attention asset.
