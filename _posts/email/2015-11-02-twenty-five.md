### The next computing paradigm

If someone showed you an early version of the HTML specification, or even the internet, do you think you could have foreseen it's future impact on the marketing industry? Would you have forecast the rise of AdWords, Facebook and the demise of print? What about the rise of marketing automation and SaaS giants like Salesforce? I'm sure I wouldn't have.

The reason the internet was and continues to be so disruptive is that it was a new computing paradigm. And new computing paradigms are rare and highly impactful. Why am I talking about new computing paradigms? We could be at the cusp of the next one.

The paradigm, decentralized computing, is bought to life by the [Ethereum project][eth]. As HTML made TCP/IP accessible and therefore viable, Ethereum looks to make the Bitcoin blockchain accessible and therefore viable on a scale it hasn't been about to reach previously.

Decentralized computing has the potential to change the marketing industry (and many others) in ways we can't foresee right now, I'd highly recommend you read this [great primer][ethprimer] on the topic.

Four years ago, home decor brand One Kings Lane launched a typical blog where staffers would pen two or three posts per week. Traffic was decent, but the site had yet to really take off in a way that would make the publishing efforts stand out.

### 3. [Why fraudulent ad networks continue to thrive][adfraud]
_<strong>Ad fraud</strong>_

Imagine a scammer who runs a network of 1,000 fake sites that pretend to serve ads. Each site reports average traffic of one million page views per month. Conservatively, assume 10 ads populate each page, At an 80 percent sell-through, a CPM of 75 cents, and 40-percent revenue share, such a network would generate $2.4 million per month.

Even the best personas tend to be descriptive, but not predictive. If personas are a design-tool to help us get the customers we want, they should potentially become more predictive.
