# The process - how does it work?

short intro with link to full process - as blog post or interactive demo

## Setup

The goals of the setup period is to get an effective campaign live as quickly as possible, to deliver momentum quickly and to present an emerging strategy after three months of testing. Prior to launching the campaign we need to be assured that we have the understanding required to deliver results profitably.

## Understand the Business

During the setup period we tak the time to understand the nuances of your business. What's your business model? How successful are your current channels? What channels would work best for your business? What are your current conversion rates? Who are your customer segments and what makes them tick?

We answer these questions by reviewing sales data and analytics, talking to you and key stakeholders and performing research on third party tools.

## Model Tests and Expected Results

With the initial understanding of the business underway we produce a test plan for the first three months. The test plan outlines the key hypothesis we recommend testing and methodologies used to do so. The test outlines the key variable we wish to test, for example the landing page creative. The methodology describes how we'll construct the test details required to gain accurate results such as media spend, time to run the test and the require conversion rates to gain statistical significance.

The expected results is where we model the business profitability we expect our marketing activity to deliver. What's the net present value of our activity? When is the payback period? What's the internal rate of return? This model forms the bedrock of our reporting back to you. If we can't deliver profits, we haven't done our job.

## Initial Production

With the tests and expectations modelled, we move on producing the initial campaign. The deliverables include:

* **Messaging** the optimal conversion angle/s to take

* **Performance media** setup of the initial campaign

* **User experience** the composition of the landing page

* **Copy** the rollout of the messaging across owned and purchased channels

* **Design** outline of the style guide (if not existant) and identification of key imagary to be used

* **Build** producing the landing page and performance media ads

## Three month trial

The first three months is used as a trial for the campaign. It enables us to firm up our modeled expectations with real results rather than assumptions. Weekly reporting and optimisation Work In Progress (WIP) meetings get you into the groove of agile marketing.

At the end of the three month period we present the emergent strategy. The strategy outlines key acquisition recommendations based on the insights derrived over three months of customer acquisition.

## Maintainance

Three months is rarly enough time to tune an acquisition campaign. To get the most out of your investment its critical to optimise channels, keywords, customer segments, messaging and the combination of the above. As your customer acquisition funnel becomes increasingly sophisticated your aim should be to deliver a optimal, personalised experience for different customer segments based on sum of your understanding on what converts the best.
