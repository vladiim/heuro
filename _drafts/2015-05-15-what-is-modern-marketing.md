Marketing has entered a new age.

The skill sets required for successful modern marketers couldn't be more different from marketers 20 years ago. In this post I explore how some of the traits of modern marketers vary from their counterparts.

Also evolved is the role modern marketers can play within their organisations - never before has marketing had such an influence on the direction and composition of business.

In an age of continuously increased channel fragmentation, immediate information access and evolving interpersonal communication tools brands have never had more ways to connect with customers. It is my firm belief and experience that successful modern brands are ones that demonstrate an obsession over their customers and execute with a foundation of data-driven insights.

It is my firm belief and experience that successful modern brands are ones that demonstrate an obsession over their customers and execute with a foundation of data-driven insights.

The driver behind the new branding paradigm is the changed nature of channels and an evolved sales funnel.

Contrary to their static forefathers, channels today are dynamic super-platforms that reach millions of active users in months. Traditional business would not recognise eBay as a channel, but PayPal built a multi-billion dollar business and brand on top of eBay. Traditional news mastheads didn't understand the full power of leveraging the reader as a channel, but Buzzfeed's recognition of this fact have led to them consistently shaping the global Zeitgeist.

My career has been the pursuit of the new marketing paradigm. Over the last 12 years in digital marketing I have gone from building an SME's first eCommerce presence to helping some of the world's biggest businesses drive brand and organisational change. I've spear-headed Novartis's evolution of their global sales organisation, created and grown digital-first brands for the UK Film Council organisations and guided an 80 year old brand, Blackmores on how to take a strategic left turn to digital. I've also worked with eBay across Europe and the US to increase brand reputation and trust with sellers via a multitude of customer experience programmes.

In doing the above I've led the co-ordination of large multi-disciplinary teams and worked with executives at the global board level to drive modern brands forward. I not only have a strong grasp and experience with marketing and management but I am an avid developer of both computational and statistical programmes. I can therefore offer Qantas an understanding of technology and data at a deep level.

The fundamental driver behind the new branding paradigm is the changed nature of channels. Channels were once static and required media planners to purchase inventory from sales managers. The last twenty years has seen an explosion of dynamic, ever-changing channels that can be leveraged not through media buys but through the programming of functionality and content.

These new channels are super-platforms that reach hundreds of millions of active users in months, some dying off as quickly as they grew. Their growth offers unparalleled opportunities for astute marketers to gain new audiences.

Traditional business would not recognise eBay as a channel, but PayPal built its business and brand on top of eBay and is now arguably worth more than eBay. Traditional marketing departments wouldn't recognise Craigslist as a channel, but by integrating listings from their site to Craigslist, an early Airbnb managed to gain the traction required to kick off a global brand.

Marketers that can take advantage of the new paradigm need a deep technology and data understanding. They
