### 2. [The secret to writing killer product copy][killercopy]
_<strong>Copywriting</strong>_

Some good examples of customer-led copy in the article. It sounds elementary but most marketers produce copy that's disconnected from their customers. "It doesn’t matter if it’s an email we’re sending, copy on a landing page, or text in a tool-tip inside of our product, everything that we write has to be written in a way that our customers will understand and care about."

### 7. [Recommender systems – it’s not all about the accuracy][recsys]
_<strong>Data informed</strong>_

If I've listened to a Michael Jackson song it's pretty obvious I'm going to like other MJ music. To offer value, a recommendation system should offer me music that's like MJ but different, surprising, perhaps something I've never heard before. This article covers the key considerations of recommender systems at a high-level, including:

* Diversity – How dissimilar are the recommendations?

* Coverage – What percentage of the user-item space can be recommended?

* Serendipity – How surprising are the relevant recommendations?

* Novelty – How surprising are the recommendations in general?

* Relevancy – How relevant are the recommendations?
