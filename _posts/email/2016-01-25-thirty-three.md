### 2. [The spread of misinformation online][misinform]
_<strong>Trends</strong>_

"Massive digital misinformation is becoming pervasive in online social media to the extent that it has been listed by the World Economic Forum (WEF) as one of the main threats to our society."

### 3. [The content marketing handbook][contenthandbook]
_<strong>Content</strong>_

A 30,000+ word book on content marketing by Pricenomics, a company who's unique approach to content marketing has flooded the internet. This is a must-read, key outtakes:

* Providing information that is unique, authentic, and interesting is currency

* Every outlet, even The New York Times, gets its traffic from third party platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook that control most of the audience

* Content channels (journalists, social news sites, etc.) are “supernodes” for reaching larger audiences

* To create truly unique content identify where your company's data intersects with peoples interests.

### 6. [Where digital brands succeed and fail at brand relevance][digibrandrel]
_<strong>Brand</strong>_

Altimeter, conducted research that asked 10,000 US consumers to rate 400 brands across 27 categories along 16 different criteria. Some takeouts:

* Customer experience is paramount: the Internet brands in the Top 50 are much more likely to rank higher than their peers on the criteria “makes me happy”

* As a group, these brands are much more likely to “make me feel inspired”

* All Internet brands fall short on trust — except for Amazon.
