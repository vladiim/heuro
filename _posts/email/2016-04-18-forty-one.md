### 4. [The fallacy of measuring everything][measure]
_<strong>Data informed</strong>_

From now on, when a person, blog or speaker at a conference tells you to "measure everything..." instantly realise that they're being unrealistic, naive, and setting you up for failure. Their advice is lazy, grossly inaccurate and disconnected from reality. The better advice would be to identify 2 to 3 metrics (key performance indicators) that you know you can track, start there. Start small, get Nyour feet wet with the idea of measuring and making decisions from data then slowly work your way into consuming more data.
