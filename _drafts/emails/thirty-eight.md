_<strong>Strategy</strong>_

Leveraging off the world's biggest eCommerce business, Amazon is using its scale to tax an increasing number of markets:

2. **Premium eCommerce** though Amazon makes no profit from product sales it taxes its most engaged members with the Amazon Prime membership fee

3. **Logistics** Amazon now has 26 planes in a private logistics network and has identified “companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline” as competition in it's latest annual report.
