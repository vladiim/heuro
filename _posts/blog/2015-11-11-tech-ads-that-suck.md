{% image tech_ads_suck/twitter_moments.png %}

Twitter has just released its [first ad campaign][twittermoment] to promote its new moments product. Twitter's followed on from a long-line of consumer-internet companies whose first attempt at brand advertising is not much more than an uninspiring, self-involved flop.

In 2012, Facebook launched [Chairs][fbchairs], which featured a series of random photos of chairs, sentimental music and a voiceover compelling us that Facebook is like - chairs. "Chairs are for people and thatâ€™s why chairs are like Facebook." Deep.

Earlier this year, Airbnb launched [Is Mankind?][ismankind] Another introspective piece that tried to encourage the kindness of man, but ended up simple [creeping people out][airbnbcreep].

### Why are their ads so far off-mark?

These ads are presumably aiming to drive brand awareness and product trail amongst non tech-savvy consumers. The blame for the navel-gazing, self-indulgent nature of the ads should rest squarely with the client who seemingly:

* Assume people get and care about their mission statement as much as their management team, staff, VCs and fans

* Aspire to be Apple and deliver the next [1984][apple1984] ad, Airbnb and Twitter hired the same agency that produced Apple's famous ad

* Default to being "flamboyantly creative" when approaching advertising to avoid appearing stale.

### When they get it right

There are of course examples of many consumer-internet companies that have created advertising campaigns whose creativity and engagement matches that of their business.

In 2014, Google demonstrated it's Siri equivalent, by [embedding context-relevant query suggestions][okgoogle] around New York.

Microsoft aligned their [Bing campaign][bingdecode] with Jay-Z's Decoded autobiography launch. To launch the book and promote Bing, pages from the book were plastered in unexpected locations across the US. This set up an elaborate online/offline game where players found clues to the page's location on bing.com/jay-z. Various prizes were rewarded for the most successful players including two tickets to any of Jay-Z's concerts for life.

Intel's chips power the best computers in the world but the brand has little awareness. To highlight their selling proposition they created a film, [The Beauty Inside][beautyinside]. The story was about Alex, a guy who wakes up everyday as a different person and needs to communicate who he is to a love interest. Intel opened the casting for the lead to its fans on social and saw a flood of entries. Portions of the film got over 11 million views prior to launch and the final product won a number of prestigious film awards.

There are a few clear patterns in the tech companies who have hit the mark with their advertising. Funnily enough, their the same patterns as any successful ad. Successful advertising:

* Has a unique selling proposition that is communicated clearly

* Seamlessly interacts with its medium whilst pushing the medium's boundaries

* Is contextually aware and taps into / pushes forward the cultural zeitgeist.
