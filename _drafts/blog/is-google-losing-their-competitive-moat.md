## Online advertising is no longer dominated by search

Google maintains more than [60% of worldwide market share][googleshare]. Their dominance in search has enabled them to capture the lion's share of the [$50 billion per year][pwcinternetads] search revenue. Search has historically been far more profitable than display advertising at [$34 billion per year][pwcinternetads], therefore Google has dominated the most lucrative slice of the online advertising pie. It's critical to note that search only covers one aspect of the purchasing funnel, intent.

In [Peak Google][feedads], [Ben Thompson][benthom] argues that Google's dominance of the $50 billion search pie is increasingly being eclipsed by total online advertising which is now at [$545 billion (2014)][2014rev].

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite the hype about disruption, the truth is most tech giants, particularly platform providers, are not so much displaced as they are eclipsed.</p>
  <footer>Ben Thompson</footer>
</blockquote>

Thompson furthers his argument by demonstrating cases such as IBM (mainframes) eclipsed by Microsoft (PCs) and Microsoft (PCs) by Apple (smartphone profit) and Google (smartphone share). To date Google's only real competition in online advertising has been banner ads however the rise of native advertising which will capture increasing portions of the purchasing funnel.

## Search is only a small proportion of the purchase funnel

-- mery meeker slide

funnel (stage / customer need) - awareness (affiliation with a brand), interest / intent (active research to inform my purchase), purchase (fulfilment), ownership (lifecycle management)

Search captures one portion of the purchase funnel - intent. During this phase a person has already made up their mind that they need a specific service, brand or product. And as such are now ready to buy and want to inform themselves with more information about their purchase decision.

Traditionally, marketers have focussed on the awareness portion of the purchase funnel. By doing so marketers carve top-of-mind awareness of their brand with consumers. To achieve awareness at scale marketers leverage strong creative executions through traditional media such as TV, outdoor, radio and print. Online display has been a poor cousin to these mediums in terms of its impact on consumers and this is reflected in display's meagre share of advertising wallets and creative resources.

The way we become aware of and affiliate with brands is changing. We discover new products and ideas through Instagram and people actively recommend products they love through Facebook and Twitter. All of these properties live online and have a powerful brand mechanism - the newsfeed.

we can see this change in awareness in consumer tech as companies grow to hundreds of millions of active users overnight with no traditional advertising. 

Given the importance of word-of-mouth (WOM) advertising in a socially connected world it's increasingly critical for businesses to maintain a strong relationship with customers post purchase. - talk about the growth of crm - move into new crm paradigm, chat

 word-of-mouth is increasingly important in discovery / affiliation - everyone of us is a channel. products are now more important than brands (scott galloway)

The dominant amount of resources spent by the marketing and advertising profession has been on building brands. A strong brand leads to top-of-mind awareness. This ownership brand's have of people's minds means when a consumer is in the toothpaste section of a supermarket aisle they'll pick up Colgate without consciously making a decision. Traditionally, online advertising (read display ads and Google) has been poor at building brands. Television as a medium has been able to keep its advertising revenue due to this fact.

facebook owns instagram (brand), facebook (WOM) and whatsapp / messanger (CRM) and they'll tie this to identity - tie to prof scott galloway

facebook will own identity
