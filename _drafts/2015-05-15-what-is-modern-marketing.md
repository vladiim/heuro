## 1. Data-driven

The modern marketer is data-driven. Being data-driven involves judging any marketing activity or creative based on traction rather than subjective reasoning. Data-driven marketers invest in tools and processes that enable new ideas to be published and tested rapidly and continuously. By constantly publishing and testing ideas with their target audience they identify potentially successful ideas quickly. Successful ideas are given additional investment in order to reach their full potential.

FMCG juggernaut Kraft now generates 1.1bn ad impressions a year and four times the return on investment through content marketing [claims][kraft-content] their director of data, content and media. Kraft's content publishing efforts allow them to track 22k attributes of over 100m web visitors per year and thereby build stronger customer behavioural profiles and increasingly informed and personalised targeting.

Amazon is famous for its data-driven approach to marketing. The business constantly publishes and tears down tweaks to its site and slowly builds out creative as it proves itself successful. In [one famous example][amazon-creative] Amazon generated an additional $2.7bn annual revenue by optimising their review interface.

Data-driven marketers have unparalleled importance within an organisation as they can prove that a $5 investment leads to a $10 return.

## 2. Customer obsessed

(netflix paying customers | nike plus)

In the past businesses had control over how consumers accessed information about their products and organisation. Control enabled marketers to be selective in the information they communicated. To fully understand a product, a primed buyer would generally have to visit a retailer and speak to a sales assistant.

Marketer's control has completely gone out the window thanks to the unparalleled access to information all consumers now have at their finger tips. This has completely changed shopping behaviour to the point where all the information one could hope for about a product is a Google search away. Google went as far as to coin the new phenomena the [Zero Moment of Truth (ZMOT)][zmot].

This change in power has meant the companies that survive and thrive are those that obsess over their customers and offer optimal experiences across their products and touchpoints. Netflix would never have existed was it not for the poor customer experience provided by Blockbuster. In 1997 the [idea of Netflix came to Reed Hastings][netflix] after he was charge $40 from Blockbuster in late fees. The fees were a quick profit win for Blockbuster and their shareholders but their culture of focusing on short-term profits over positive customer experiences were ultimately their undoing. In the meantime Netflix has over 65m streaming subscribers paying $10 a month.

By obsessing and understanding customer needs enables new categories to be created. In 2006 Nike launched a running shoe that synced with your iPod in order to gain market share in the European running category. Today [Nike Plus][nike-plus] is a global community of sports enthusiasts catering for everyone from runners and basketballers through to dancers and yogis.

## 3. Dynamic channels

Before today's proliferation of communication channels you could count a marketer's channel options on one hand. The mediums were static by nature, media plans were purchased many months in advance and creative would need to be finalized well before the publish date. Companies like Nielsen were built in order to prove media viewing. In the US Nielsen has tracking devices installed on 1.2k consumer TV sets, they then extrapolate statistics from these homes to represent the entire US.

Today new mediums and channels are born daily. Startups like Meerkat pop up overnight and within months have hundreds of millions of active users. Unlike previous mediums, these new channels are digital and therefore programmatic and inherently measurable. The modern marketer knows how to leverage and exploit the fundamental shift in the dynamic properties of new channels.

A traditional marketer would not have viewed eBay as a channel in 2000 - it was an online marketplace. Yet, PayPal was able to build their business off the back of smart integrations on the eBay channel. Similarly, an early Airbnb built up their initial customer base through a [Craigslist integration][gh]. To create their 'post to Craigslist' feature Airbnb wrote a custom script that filled in a form on Craigslist. This is a new paradigm of channel utilization.

New channels offer huge opportunities to early entrants however returns [quickly diminish][ctr] as the channel matures and is saturated. Therefore successful modern marketers are able to identify and execute activity on new channels early in their lifecycle. These marketers ask how they can leverage an Uber driver, Dropbox notifications or the Apple Watch as a channel.

The fragmentation of dynamic channels has meant that traditional brand conglomerates have had to completely re-evaluate their business. recently Procter & Gamble announced that they will shed more than half its brands, [arguably][png], in order to manage the prolifically more complex channel environment.

## 4. Always on

Customers are at various stages of the buying cycle at any given moment. The marketing campaign, though important, has increasingly limited benefits to the modern marketer. Modern marketers recognize their customer's need for information and engagement at all times and focus on various activities to maintain relevance throughout the year.

To continuously engage customers modern marketers constantly refine brand-building content, the search experience, website content and customer feedback. By continuously engaging their customers with valuable content modern marketers gain reach by leveraging customer advocacy and convert new people into prospects through owned media channels such as their email database.

Constant production of content requires a new skill set from marketers and agencies alike and can lead to serendipitous success of unparalleled scale. A classic example happened during the [Oreo 100 day campaign][100] where the brand was celebrating its 100 year birthday by publishing a new ad every day for a hundred days. Each ad was a commentary on a current trend told with Oreo cookies and published online. During the 2013 Superbowl, Oreo published the tweet above in response to a power outage. The tweet was published 8 minutes after the event and allowed Oreo to own the conversion around the Superbowl without spending a cent on the most expensive media buy of all time.

## 5. Technologists

Analytics, data integration, content marketing systems, automated marketing tools, social listening platforms and customer relationship management systems. These are but a few of the technologies marketers need to understand to be a modern marketer.

Rapidly growing marketing IT budgets have led to the [prediction][budget] that marketers will spend more on IT than, ahem, IT. Unlike traditional IT departments who are inherently risk adverse and slow to move, marketing's use of IT is dynamic and ever-changing. It is for this reason that large enterprises are now seeing the rise of the [Chief Marketing Technologist (CMT)][cmt].

The role of the CMT is to bridge marketing and IT. Ensuring vendor engagement, utilization and integration to enable creative execution. The skills required to run and integrate marketing technologies are becoming increasingly complex. In order to have an edge over competitors marketers will need to configure these technologies in unique ways in order to get the most out of them. This trend will lead to increasing specialisation of marketing technologists.
