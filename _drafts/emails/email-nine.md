## Trends

"Predictions are useless, but predicting is invaluable." Scott Galloway with [several important digital predictions][digitalpred] for the next decade including:

1. Facebook is winning the war on serving relevant advertising based on identity and as such will continue taking market capitalisation from Google

2. The biggest media story in 2016 will be that Facebook is disrupting YouTube

3. Uber is ups + FedEx + US Post + GM + amazon.com and it will hit $1 trillion in market capitalisation in five years

4. All pureplay ecommerce businesses will either be acquired, open stores or go out of business

5. Wall-Mart will begin taking share from Amazon due to the omnichannel

6. The biggest innovation in branded advertising in the next 5-10 years will be native video advertising in social streams

7. Google Plus is dead, Tumbler is dying and Pinterest and Twitter will be acquired in the next five to ten years

8. The company in social that will have the greatest increase in value in the next two years is LinkedIn.

"In other words, the ultimate result is that there will be no advertising, not advertising of the kind that believed in investing large amounts of money to transform attitudes and behavior. Instead there will be more process and efficiency, the stuff that technology is good at, but that undermines the uniqueness of media and hence its value." Michael Wolff argues that [digital media is hollowing out agency creative][endad].
