In his ["competition is for losers" lecture][theallec] and book [Zero to One][zeroone] Facebook board member Peter Thiel outlines the importance of monopolies. Thiel's thesis is that competition is bad for business. Monopolies have to be careful not to be seen as such by government bodies so as to avoid scrutiny from government bodies.

In order not to appear as a monopoly, companies describe their business as the union of a set of vastly different markets. By doing so they increase the surface area of their business. By positioning itself as an advertising or technology company Google distracts regulators from the fact that they monopolize the search market.

Thiel's advice is evident in Facebook's strategy as the company continues to grow it's total addressable market. My questions when analysing Facebook's market strategy include:

* Is Facebook a monopoly?

* What makes up Facebook's total addressable market?

* What wider macro trends will affect Facebook's monopolistic position?

***

## Is Facebook a monopoly?

To understand if Facebook is a monopoly or not we first need to identify what they monopolise. To do this, we begin with Facebook's description of themselves.

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Our mission is to make the world more open and connected. People use Facebook to stay connected with their friends and family, to discover what is going on in the world around them, and to share and express what matters to them to the people they care about.

We can therefore extrapolate that at the most fundamental level, Facebook's business model is built around engaged, inter-connected users. We can see additional evidence of this in their key metrics Daily Active Users (DAU), Monthly Active Users (MAU) and Average Revenue Per User (ARPU). Facebook is in the user business.

With a point of view on what Facebook may be monopolising, users, we can then begin to asses if they're a monopoly. We do this by comparing Facebook with other companies looking to create value based on inter-connected users.

Using compiled data from [eBizMBA][ebizsocial] and valuation data for each company (sources with data set) we can plot Facebook's competitors based on monthly uniques and valuation per unique. Download the [data used here][fbcompdata].

<div class='graph'>
    <a href="https://plot.ly/~Vladiim/5/?share_key=mJpisWPV7LR14mS60Hw0L2" title="Unique visitors per month vs Market value per user" style="display: block; text-align: center;" target="blank"><img src="https://plot.ly/~Vladiim/5.png?share_key=mJpisWPV7LR14mS60Hw0L2" alt="Unique visitors per month vs Market value per user" style="max-width: 100%;width: 662px;"  width="662" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://plot.ly/404.png';" /></a>
    <script data-plotly="Vladiim:5" sharekey-plotly="mJpisWPV7LR14mS60Hw0L2" src="https://plot.ly/embed.js" async></script>
</div>

So is Facebook a monopoly? Based on this data set we can assume so, as Facebook:

1. Dwarfs competitors in terms of valuation per unique user

2. Has 4.9 times more unique users (900 million) vs the competitor set median (185 million)

3. Has nearly an order of magnitude, 9.2 times, more unique users (1.7 billion) vs the competitor set median when combined with the other companies it owns within the set (WhatsApp & Instagram).

Couple the above with the maturity of Facebook's marketing platform in terms of user targeting and breadth of ad types and the amount of data points Facebook has for an individual user compared to competitors. And you've got a serious gap for anyone to fill to become remotely competitive with Facebook's current infrastructure when it comes creating an monetizing inter-connected users.

## What makes up Facebook's total addressable market?

In Facebook's [filing document][s1] for their IPO they list advertising and online payments as their addressable markets.

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Our addressable market opportunity **includes portions of many existing advertising markets**, including the traditional offline branded advertising, online display advertising, online performance-based advertising, and mobile advertising markets.
  <p>

If we take Facebook's S1 Filing guidance, we can plot out Facebook's historic and future addressable market. Download the plot data [here][fbtamdat].

[fbtamdat]:http://www.heuro.net/assets/data/advertising_revenue.csv

<div class='graph'>
    <a href="https://plot.ly/~Vladiim/48/" target="blank" title="Facebook&#39;s total addressable market" style="display: block; text-align: center;"><img src="https://plot.ly/~Vladiim/48.png" alt="Facebook&#39;s total addressable market" style="max-width: 100%;width: 748px;"  width="748" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://plot.ly/404.png';" /></a>
    <script data-plotly="Vladiim:48"  src="https://plot.ly/embed.js" async></script>
</div>

As we can see, on a log10 graph, Facebook is gaining some ground on the digital and total advertising share however it's revenue proportion pales compared to these large markets.

<div class='graph'>
    <a href="https://plot.ly/~Vladiim/63/" target="blank" title="Facebook revenue %" style="display: block; text-align: center;"><img src="https://plot.ly/~Vladiim/63.png" alt="Facebook revenue %" style="max-width: 100%;width: 685px;"  width="685" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://plot.ly/404.png';" /></a>
    <script data-plotly="Vladiim:63"  src="https://plot.ly/embed.js" async></script>
</div>

As a percentage of revenue of these large markets, Facebook can get 13% of the digital advertising revenue and less than 4% of the total global advertising advertising revenue by 2016 (given accurate forecasts). Thereby safely dismissing any claims that Facebook is a monopoly within its stated total addressable market.

## What wider macro trends will affect Facebook's monopolistic position?

There are at least three critical macro trends which Facebook are positioned to take advantage of to grow their monopolistic position:

* The next four billion users

* Digital advertising viewability

* Failing media experiences

* Online video.

## The next four billion users

Less than half of the world has access to the internet and the race is on to impact four billion people by getting them online. Google's [Project Loon][ploon] is providing internet through a network of balloons traveling on the edge of space and Facebook's [internet.org][intorg] is exploring a variety of technologies including high-altitude long-endurance planes, satellites and lasers.

As people in emerging markets come online they will have an entirely different set of needs to people in developed economies. By facilitating the next four billion internet users coming online Google and Facebook aim to have critical influence of the next economic wave online.

Facebook's influence of online users is evident in their efforts in South East Asia where millions of emerging market Facebook users [don't realize they're using the Internet][fbusersint]. If Facebook is successful with internet.org, they may be the only viable access point to the next population of internet users.

## Digital advertising viewability

{% image fb_tam/low_cpm.jpeg %}

In 2013 the Wall St Journal [reported that only 54% of ads were viewable][75adfraud] when comScore researched thousands of display campaigns. While media agencies and marketing clients bury their heads in the sand, internet users are becoming increasingly adept at ignoring ads.

In 2014, [PageFair and Adobe found][pagefairadblock] that there are around 144 million global adblock users, a 70% year-on-year increase from June 2013 to June 2014. Once Apple allows [adblocking in iOS 9][adblock9] expect the awareness of adblocking to truly go mainstream.

Media providers are showing less ads to an audience who is getting better at avoiding them altogether. Meanwhile, Facebook's proprietary ad platform and native advertising solutions give them full control over viewability and adblocking in an increasingly uncertain world for marketers. Their ability to join the dots across their additional properties like WhatsApp and Instagram on compounds thier increasing stranglehold on marketers.

## Failing media experiences

{% image fb_tam/imore.png %}

As content providers load an increasing amount of ad serving software on their sites, people's web experiences will suffer. And people are noticing.

## Appendix

Notes on the graph comparing social networks:

* You can access the dataset used [here][data]

* To compare like-to-like unique monthly visitors were taken from [a source that consolidates visitor data across sites][siteusersource]

* Some of this data is obviously false however it's the best apples-to-apples comparison I could find

* For example, [Facebook reported][q1fbearn] 1.39 billion monthly active users in Q1 2015, the data given reports 900 million unique monthly visitors

* Google Plus+ is impossible to value so I used median market value per user of $39

* Tumblr's value calculation came from their 2013 buyout at $1.1 billion when they had 300 million users

* Instagrams's value calculation came from their 2012 buyout at $1 billion when they had 30 million users

* VK's value calculation came from Mail.ru's 48% purchase at $1.47 billion when they had 92 million monthly active users
