### 1. [2016 internet trends report][internettrends]
_<strong>Trend</strong>_

As always, Mary Meeker's Internet Trends Report is amazingly researched, insightful and makes you want to go out and create a startup. Some of my key marketing take-aways from this year's report:

* Google + Facebook = 76% share of internet ad growth

* Adblocking @ ~220MM desktop (+16%) and ~420MM mobile (+94$)

* Commerce + brands evolving rapidly by / for this generation

* Internet-enabled retailers / products / brands on rise bolstered by always-on connectivity + hyper-targeted marketing + images + personalisation

* Technology at an inflection point: messaging, new human / computer interfaces (voice, transportation)

### 5. [TV advertising’s surprising strength — and inevitable fall][tvad]
_<strong>Channels</strong>_

Linear television and its advertisers were all predicated on owning distribution and thus owning customers. The Internet has or is in the process of destroying their business models for broadly similar reasons; for now the intertwinement of these models is keeping everyone afloat, but that only means that when the end comes it will come more swiftly and broadly than anyone is expecting.
