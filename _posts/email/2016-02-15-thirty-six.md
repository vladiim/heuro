### Overcoming bullshit A/B tests

Some quick thoughts on the [first article][abbs] in this week's list:

* Issues in A/B testing usually come from a lack of understanding of some simple fundamentals

* There are three important factors to multivariate testing: variance (the difference in results), sample size (how many observations you have) and your interpretation of statistical significance

* To ensure variance always aim to test extremes, not just a button's colour (the canonical e.g.)

* Tests should also be based on real insights and opposing while rationale hypothesis not just knee-jerk ideas

* If there's a sample size issue (ie not enough site visitors), use performance media, you get significant results faster with more people - simples

* For statistical significance, use an 80% confidence interval

* Digital marketing doesn't require the 95% confidence interval that a pharmaceutical drug does

* The trade off between more tests vs some confidence loss is worth it.

### 8. [Winners & losers in the global app economy][appecon]
_<strong>Trends</strong>_

Excellent research report looking into, arguably, the first global market for digital goods. Key outtakes:

* Despite its egalitarian appeal, developer participation in the app economy is heavily skewed toward the largest and richest economies

* 95% of the estimated value in the app economy is captured by just 10 countries

* Language and spatial proximity influence app trade flows

* Developers in low-income countries struggle to export to the global stage.
