### From attention to retention

I attended [Marketo's conference][marketo] last week. I was happy to see a theme reiterated by the most engaging speaks - that marketing is becoming a revenue centre rather than a cost centre. The marketing to sales, attention to intention, food chain has collapsed. The funnel is randomising across an omnichannel environment and we are now in a customer-led economy. This all ladders up to one thing, marketing have an increasingly important place in business.

The shift won't just happen. It will take marketers who are willing to move from focusing on consumer attention to customer retention. These marketers will need to drive change in organisations that don't want to change. They will focus on the customer experience, insights and personalised marketing automation over large-scale media buys. They'll rip apart agency relationships, vendor contracts, current staff make-up and budgets. They'll have the x-suite's attention and drive the organisation's business strategy.

Ready?
