### 2. [Imaging, Snapchat and mobile][mobsnap]
_<strong>Trends</strong>_

For the first time, pretty much everyone on earth is going to have a camera. But terms like camera or photo, like phone, are inherently limiting - they specify one particular use for underlying technology that can do many things. Using a smartphone camera just to take and send photos is a little like using Word for memos that you used to create on a typewriter - you're using a new tool to fit into old forms. Pretty soon you work out that new forms are possible.

Progressive web apps could be the next big thing for the mobile web. Originally proposed by Google in 2015, they have already attracted a lot of attention because of the relative ease of development and the almost instant wins for the application’s user experience.

### 4. [Use big data to create value for customers, not just target them][bigcustdata]
_<strong>Customer obsessed</strong>_

To build lasting advantage, marketing programs that leverage big data need to turn to more strategic questions about longer term customer stickiness, loyalty, and relationships. The questions that need to be asked of big data are not just what will trigger the next purchase, but what will get this customer to remain loyal.

_<strong>Customer obsessed</strong>_

UX is a lot more than buttons and wireframes. The stuff that seems obvious is only the tip of the iceberg, and the stuff that matters most is completely invisible.

### 7. [Publishers should focus on doing what Google and Facebook don’t do][publisherfbg]
_<strong>Channels</strong>_

### 8. [Beginner's guide to marketing funnel analysis][marketingfunnel]
_<strong>Data informed</strong>_

“Google AdWords and Organic Search drive 80% of our new subscribers, but growth is flat year-on-year so we’re exploring Facebook ads as a new channel. We’ve spent $600 so far, and we’re acquiring new users at half our $2.50 CPA target. That said, these users are also buying half as much, so they net out at the same ROI.”

Awesome. Now how do you do that?
