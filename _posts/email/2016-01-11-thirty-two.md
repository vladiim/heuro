_<strong>Design thinking</strong>_

It is important to discover the assumptions built in to a project. This responsibility is shared, but designers are often in the best position to lead this discovery because we deal both with understanding a user’s needs and the tools we might use to implement a solution.

### 8. [10 web marketing predictions worth reading][10preds]
_<strong>Trends</strong>_

The beginning of each new year sees a flood of prediction and trend articles. Few are worth reading, however Rand Fishkin at Moz is one of those. Here are some of my highlights from his article:

1. Mobile's usage growth rate compare to desktop will stop

2. The death of normal distributions will hit both publishing and search results hard

3. The rise of adblocking is going to trigger attempts at legislation and incite more sites to restrict adblocking users

4. DuckDuckGo will be the fastest-growing search engine of 2016

5. The "big" trends for 2016: Wearables, VR, smart home, and Internet of Things will have almost no impact on the world of web marketing
