Customer personas allow us to discuss our business based on the people that make our business, our customers. Personas do this by giving us actionable insights of our customer's needs and drivers.

In order to give you a starting point for a customer persona, I thought I'd create two generic millennial personas that you could then build on for your business. Millennials, people born from 1980 to 2000 are increasingly, some [would argue][fixation] obsessively, getting attention from the press, research companies and marketers. So I thought they would be a good place to start.

## Persona one - older millennial

Forrester [breaks Millennials up into two distinct groups][forrester] - younger (18 to 24) and older (25 to 34). The groups have major differences acrosss employment, life-stage and income. In line with their findings I'll be producing a persona for each group.

## Refining the personas

This persona is a starting point. For it to be useful for a business they need to be refined based on the business customer's particular quirks and needs. To identify these, customer research is required. I'm currently writing a series on persona and customer journey map research methodologies so please sign up to the email in order to be notified when the article's come out.

We also need to identify and define the range of personas that best describe our business. Generally this will be three to five distinct personas that we can define for a given business.

## Using the personas

Personas help us prioritise what our business focusses on and evaluate what we're doing by evaluating it from the point of view of the customer. To do so we ask:

* What goal are they trying to achieve?

* How do they currently achieve their goal?

    - What's their current behaviour (motivation x trigger x ability)?

    - What product / service do they hire to achieve their goal?

    - What pains / gains are associated with their current product / service?

* What context/s are they in?
