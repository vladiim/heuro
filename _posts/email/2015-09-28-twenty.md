### Delicate brand trust

Volkswagen (VW) is responsible for producing around 10% of the world's cars in an ever-demanding industry. Automotive manufacturers need to balance customer demand more performance and regulator demand lower pollution emissions. VW couldn't balance these demands, so it cheated. Since 2009 VW have been fitting vehicles with software that falsifies nitrogen-oxide emissions in the lab.

The scandal will be costly for VW. Between 500,000 and 11 million cars worldwide will need to be recalled, they have set aside €6.5 billion to cover just the immediate service requirements, their market capitalisation plummeted over 20% in a week and their CEO resigned. However, considering they employ 274,000 people in Germany alone and help drive the most important economy in the EU, it's possible that VW like US banks, is too big to fail.

Regardless, VW's recent incident should serve as a reminder to any industry that it takes decades to build brand trust and a second to destroy it. It will be interesting to see the long-term impact of this debacle on VW's brand and sister brands like Audi and Porche.
