### The messaging train

In May I [wrote about][futurecrm] the potential for Facebook Messenger to be the next evolution of CRM. Now that [Facebook has more accounts on chat apps than on its social network][messagera] and [it's is doubling down on messaging][fbmsocial] it appears that Messenger could be that and more.

Want to change an airline booking? Manage e-commerce receipts? Technical question about your computer? All will be able to be managed on Messenger. Better yet, marketers will get a communications platform on top of a customer's mobile profile (identification) and social connections (advocacy).

The marketers that will most successfully leverage the platform will understand how it adds value in the customer journey and marry the technology to automation processes and business operations. As a marketer I'm exited, as an individual, terrified.
