### 1. [An emotional connection matters more than customer satisfaction][emot]
_<strong>Customer obsessed</strong>_

New research across hundreds of brands in dozens of categories shows that the most effective way to maximise customer value is to move beyond mere customer satisfaction and connect with customers at an emotional level – tapping into their fundamental motivations and fulfilling their deep, often unspoken emotional needs . That means appealing to any of dozens of “emotional motivators” such as a desire to feel a sense of belonging, to succeed in life, or to feel secure.

_<strong>Content</strong>_

For a content experience to be successful, all the house’s builders must be on site: content producers, UX and UI designers, developers, marketers, SEO specialists and leadership teams. “Content” is an umbrella term that often means different things to different teams, which is why it’s imperative to make sure you’re all on the same page.

### 5. [The absolutely epic Periodic Table of Marketing Signals][marketingsignals]
_<strong>Data informed</strong>_

The Periodic Table of Marketing Signals is a visual representation of the Marketing Signals Framework and organises signals across marketing channels according to three specific dimensions:

* Channel: The single channel where the marketing activity is executed. It can be digital (e.g., display, paid search, social) or offline (e.g., print, TV, radio).

* Objective: The specific business objective of the campaign or activity. Signals are categorised by the following objectives: awareness, engagement, conversion, loyalty, and advocacy.

* Signal Type: The approach used to quantify campaign success. Signals are organised by volume, quality, efficiency and shares.

Using this framework, marketers can easily identify the signals that matter based on the campaign objective or marketing activity, channels used for activation, and the approach used to quantify success.

### 7. [Principles of calm technology][calmtech]
_<strong>Customer obsessed</strong>_

Our world is made of information that competes for our attention. What is necessary? What is not? When we design products, we aim to choose the best position for user interface components, placing the most important ones in the most accessible places on the screen.

Equally important is the design of communication. How many are notifications are necessary? How and when should they be displayed? To answer this, we can be inspired by the principles of calm technology.

### 9. [Is it love or just an ad?][adlove]
_<strong>Channels</strong>_

TL;DR it's an ad.

“Ever since I started taking two @sugarbearhair a day, my hair has been fuller and stronger than ever!! Even with all the heat and bleaching I do to it!” Khloé Kardashian posted on Instagram this month.

For marketers contending with consumers who use ad blockers online and have cut the cord to their TVs in favoUr of streaming services, social media has become a way to reach an elusive audience.
