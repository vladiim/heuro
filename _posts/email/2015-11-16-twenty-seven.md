### 9. [Predictions 2016: the mobile revolution accelerates][forrestermobile]
_<strong>Trends</strong>_

A good set of insights and outlook from Forrester. Key takeaways for me (many more in the report) are:

* Consumers will continue to spend most of their time in only a few apps and will increasingly turn to aggregation apps

* More than 30% of sales will have a mobile cross-channel component, meaning consumers will use mobile at some point throughout the purchase life cycle

* Digital platforms leverage mobile and IoT data to improve their own services

* Mature marketing and eBusiness leaders will tackle cross-channel integration
