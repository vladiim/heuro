## Good strategies

Too often marketers confuse strategies with goals, a vision statement, me-too ideas/channels/technologies or a detailed marketing plan that looks very similar to last year's.

In his must read book, [Good Strategy / Bad Strategy][gsbsbook], Richard Rumelt, outlines how good strategies help to focus resources to create produce outputs that far outweigh their inputs.

Rumelt explains that good strategies are concise, easy-to-understand and are immediately actionable.

Good strategies are designed around a kernel:

* **Diagnosis** defines the problem in an insightful way

* **Guiding policy** deals with the challenge identified in the diagnosis

* **Actions** carry out the guiding policy.

I can't recommend the book enough, it's forever changed how I approach and understand the craft of strategy.

[Read it][gsbsbook], [listen to it][gsbslisten] or [watch it][bsbswatch] - better yet, do all three.

### 1. [The WSJ cracked the adblocking code][wsjadblock]
_<strong>From the blog</strong>_

Rather than play into adblocking's cat-and-mouse game, the Wall St Journal and Netflix took a different approach to advertise Netflix's new series Narcos. They created a custom piece of content, "Cocaineconomics," that people would read, watch interact with and share.

 All of the brand advertising money on TV will go somewhere; the U.S. has had about the same amount of advertising — between 1.1% and 1.4% of GDP — for as long as we’ve been measuring. And, what better place for that advertising to go than to an app that, more than any other, fills the empty spaces in people’s days?
