## Trends

The industrial revolution forced a fundamental change in global commerce, government and society. The information revolution we are currently in is set to have a similar impact on human kind and the Guardian argues that this means [the end of capitalism has begun][capend]. Some of my take-aways from the article:

* The biggest modern asset today is data yet today's economics doesn't know how to account for the asset

* States have far less power to shut down or control information as they paralyse their economy in the process

* Economic austerity and an increasing wealth gap has produced "networks you can't default on" and born a set of shadow economies.

Whether it's the end of capitalism or not the question I ask myself is how does this effect marketing and how do we leverage the fact that people's behaviour is shifting at a macro level.

In an increasing effort to become people's complete internet experience, Facebook is [testing the ability for companies to set up e-commerce shops within their Facebook pages][fbecom]. This is the logical step forward from its recent launch of Instant Articles (content publishing) and Business Messenger (CRM / CS) platforms. For a good introduction check out [an introduction to facebook ads for ecommerce][fbecomintro].

The [Economist's 2015 Big Mac index][bigmac] is out. By comparing Big Mac prices across the world the index describes the level of currency misalignment across countries based on the theory of purchasing-power parity. The overall takeout? Lots of undervalued currencies.

In the next five years, millennials will total more than $1.4 trillion in spending power, and women will likely hold at least half of this trillion-dollar bank. If brands are smart, they'll throw out the playbook and listen to what [millennial women say they want out of effective content marketing][millenialwomen].

App.net [tried][appnet] to create an ad-free Twitter and failed. Diaspora [tried][diaspora] to create an ad-free Facebook and failed. Large-scale media services rely on advertising because they can't get critical user growth by charging people money - the model doesn't seem to work. The ABC asks if [advertising is morally justifiable][admorally] discussing the importance of protecting our attention. Their argument is nobel but time-and-time again it seems that mass audiences seem to swap what's best for them in the long-term (ad-free anonymity) for a short-term benefit (free).

## Retail

Black Friday, the last Friday of November, is the biggest day of the year for retailers - it's the day they go from being in the red (negative profits) to being in the black (profitable).
