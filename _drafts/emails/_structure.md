Here’s how to find Proven Content for your audience in 3 steps:
Go to your favorite addicting site. Good ones include Reddit, YouTube, Digg, and Imgur.
Search for a phrase that your audience cares about. It’s important that you think broader than the product you sell.For example…If you sell golf gloves, your audience cares about golf. So you might search Imgur for the most shared photos of breathtaking golf courses, not just gloves.
Pick a viral photo or video about your topic. The more remarkable, the better. And guess what: the headline you clicked has also already been “validated” by virtue of this Proven Content getting a ton of shares. That means you can just copy the headline as your email subject line.
Pro Tip:
Use Proven Content if your market attracts a rabid fanbase.
Do your customers have an insatiable desire or hobby? Examples include golf, Crossfit, fashion, video games, and music.
