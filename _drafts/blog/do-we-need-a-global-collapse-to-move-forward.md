global startup ecosystem report: Humanity doesn’t see transitions between major economic eras very often, but when they come, every aspect of society gets reinvented: government, business, finance, education, medicine, energy, technology, art, and science all get upgraded. In fact, most historians would argue there have only been three such transitions before in human history: 1. Foraging to horticulture 2. Horticulture to agriculture 3. Agriculture to industrialization. The Industrial Revolution was the last great full spectrum societal transformation, and the Scientific Enlightenment that ensued gave rise to modernity. With two billion broadband Internet users and billions of smartphones now entering circulation, the necessary tools and infrastructure are in place for the Information Age to burst into full bloom, moving beyond the confines of just the technology world to transform all aspects of society. Therefore, the role of technology entrepreneurship in our global economy is now more important than ever. Increasingly, it is becoming clear that technology entrepreneurship will be the primary growth engine of this new economic era.

hollocracy book: predict and control of industrial age but today just doesn't make sense. businesses need to be highly flexible which isn't possible in a top-down authoritarian structure

The last several articles on Stratechery have formed an unintentional series:

Airbnb and the Internet Revolution described how Airbnb and the sharing economy have commoditized trust, enabling a new business model based on aggregating resources and managing the customer relationship
Netflix and the Conservation of Attractive Profits placed this commodification/aggregation concept into Clay Christensen’s Conservation of Attractive Profits framework, which states that profits are earned by the integrated provider in a value chain, and that profits shift when another company successfully modularizes the incumbent and integrates another part of the value chain
Why Web Pages Suck was primarily about the effect of programmatic advertising on web page performance, but in the conclusion I noted that the way in which ad networks were commoditizing publishers also fit the “Conservation of Attractive Profits” framework
In retrospect, there is a clear thread. In fact, I believe this thread runs through nearly every post on Stratechery, not just the last three. I am calling that thread Aggregation Theory.
