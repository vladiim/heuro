### Sprint to it

I've just finished the [Sprint][sprint] book by the team at Google Ventures. The book details a five-day design process developed within Google and is now used by businesses of all shapes and sizes to answer critical business problems quickly.

This is a master course in rapid prototyping and I'd recommend it to anyone in business, especially marketers.
