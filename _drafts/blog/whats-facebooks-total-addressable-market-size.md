title: What's Facebook's total addressable market?
categories: blog
description:
---

In his ["competition is for losers" lecture][theallec] Facebook board member Peter Thiel outlines the importance of monopolies to describe their business as the union of a set of vastly different markets. By doing so they vastly increase the surface area of their business. And thereby the number and complexity of their competitors. By demonstrating they have more competition than they really have, a monopoly dodges government regulation.

  <p>
    The basic lie you tell when you're a monopoly is that you're in a market that is much bigger than it looks.

Thiel's advice is evident in Facebook's strategy as the company continues to grow it's total addressable market. My questions when analysing Facebook's market strategy include:

* Is Facebook a monopoly?

* What markets are incorporated in Facebook's total addressable market?

* What needs to happen for Facebook to be truly competitive within each market?

* And therefore, which markets are constituents of Thiel's lie?

## Is Facebook a monopoly?

To understand if Facebook is a monopoly or not we first need to identify what they monopolise. To do this, we begin with Facebook's description of themselves.

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Our mission is to make the world more open and connected. People use Facebook to stay connected with their friends and family, to discover what is going on in the world around them, and to share and express what matters to them to the people they care about.

We can therefore extrapolate that at the most fundamental level, Facebook's business model is built around engaged, inter-connected users. We can see additional evidence of this in their key metrics Daily Active Users (DAU), Monthly Active Users (MAU) and Average Revenue Per User (ARPU). Facebook is in the user business.

With a point of view on what Facebook may be monopolising, users, we can then begin to asses if they're a monopoly. We do this by comparing Facebook with other companies looking to create value based on their users.

## What markets are incorporated in Facebook's total addressable market?

In Facebook's [filing document][s1] for their IPO they list advertising and online payments as their addressable markets.

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Our addressable market opportunity **includes portions of many existing advertising markets**, including the traditional offline branded advertising, online display advertising, online performance-based advertising, and mobile advertising markets.

Our advertising strategy centers on the belief that ad products that are social, relevant, and well-integrated with other content on Facebook can enhance the user experience while providing an attractive return for advertisers. - s1 quote

## Appendix

Notes on the graph comparing social networks:

* You can access the dataset used [here][data]

* To compare like-to-like unique monthly visitors were taken from [a source that consolidates visitor data across sites][siteusersource]

* Some of this data is obviously false, for example, [Facebook reported][q1fbearn] 1.39 billion monthly active users in Q1 2015, the data given reports 900 million unique monthly visitors

* The

* google plus+ no idea how to value so used median value $39

* know the data is wrong - e.g. fb reports 1.4 billion maus, but best we have across all sites

* tumblr value calc during 2013 buyout 300m users / $1.1 billion

* instagram 2012 buyout 30m users / $1bn

* vk - mail.ru purchase 48% at $1.47 billion with 92 million maus = $3.06bn

what needs to happen for fb to dominate?

what are the bigger trends driving fb adoption?

* people need to be sheep - happy to consume fb content

* marketers need to be lazy - don't develop their own systems, shy away from data security issues etc

* human bias? cognitive dissonance?
