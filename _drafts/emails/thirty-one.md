### What's in a prediction?

As marketers we are inherently making predictions all the time. When we launch a campaign, brand, website or social ad we are predicting that it will have an impact on some business objective.

Our issue, as marketers, is these predictions are often implicit. How much will the website raise engagement, when by? How sure are we that we're correct?

In his groundbreaking book, [Superforecasting][superforecast], Phil Tetlock uncovers what the world's best forecasters have in common. He's done this after running forecasting competitions for the last 30 years. Using his forecasting competition results, Tetlock was able to beat government intelligence agencies (CIA and others) in Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity's (IARPA) forecasting competition - not bad.

Some key insights from the book that I'm taking to change my marketing practices:

* Make specific, time-bound predictions e.g. "I am 80% confident that this change will increase daily conversion rates by 20% within a month"

* Unpack insurmountable forecasts into component parts ala [Fermi][fermi]

* Start with the outside (macro) view e.g. to estimate if a couple will stay together don't look at their wedding photos, look at the divorce statistics

* Then adopt the inside view (micro), collect as much opposing information as you can, clearly state your assumptions

* Get to an initial, informed forecast as early as possible based on existing information

* Update the forecast by small increments when relevant new information presents itself

* Review your forecast after the fact, even if you're right assess if it was a close call and understand why.

There's plenty more I haven't covered, needless to say the methodologies in the book are a powerful tool to add to your arsenal.
