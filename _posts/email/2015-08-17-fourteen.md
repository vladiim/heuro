### Open questions

There's [three billion internet users worldwide][netusers], [4.5 billion mobile users][phoneusers] and [seven billion people][netusers]. And an arms race has begun to capture value from the next four billion internet users. Google's [Project Loon][ploon] is providing internet through a network of balloons traveling on the edge of space and Facebook's [internet.org][intorg] is exploring a variety of technologies including high-altitude long-endurance planes, satellites and lasers. It's not certain who'll win, but it is certain that they'll have huge influence of an entirely new economy. Already in South East Asia, millions of emerging market Facebook users [don't realize they're using the Internet][fbusersint]. What new products and services will the next four billion rely on? Will these internet giants end up dominating marketing for emerging markets? How will global marketing priorities shift as businesses get access to burgeoning economies? I'll end with a quote from Peter Diamandis, "Want to Be a Billionaire? Impact a Billion People."
