[Jet.com][jet] launched yesterday with a subscription wholesale proposition where discounts compound with every purchase, [$140 million in funding][funding], an extremely experienced ecommerce founder and an ambition to go head-to-head with Amazon. Let's breakdown the company's customer experience (CX) to understand its potential success and emerging trends in ecommerce.

# TL;DR

* Beautiful branding, UX and UI design

* Strong proposition with a unique take on ecommerce

* Makes shopping feel like a video game - your savings add up like points

* Like an early eBay - makes shopping joyous and unexpected

* Clear trade-offs with some user flows but should be overcome by power users knowing the interface

* Still some kinks in the product (I ran across four errors) with confusing error messaging which could lead to trust issues

***

# Brand

{% image jet/brand.jpg %}

* Strong points

    - Three-letter .com of a word in the dictionary

    - Logo is a smily face incorporating the first letter of the name - simple, light-hearted and unique

    - Purple as a highlight colour clearly differentiates the brand from competitors and balances out their price-heavy positioning with a regal colour

    - Excessive use of white space

    - Bold unique engaging illustration style

## Homepage

{% image jet/home_zoom_out.jpg %}

Jet's homepage layout takes cues from sites like [Simple][simple], [Oscar][oscar] and [Virgin America][va]. A clutter-free hero section above-the-fold, a clear call-to-action (CTA) followed by the product benefits.

[simple]:https://www.simple.com/

[oscar]:https://www.hioscar.com/

[va]:https://www.virginamerica.com/

{% image jet/home_zoom_in.jpg %}

* Strong points

    - Encourages quick buy-in and action by following [Simon Sinek's Why, How, What][why] format

* Weak points

    - Unclear proposition - "Club price savings on pretty much anything you buy" is much weaker than "Shop smart, save hard" which is the tagline used in the video

## Video

{% image jet/demo.png %}

* Strong points

    - Packed full of humor

    - Well known actor, in character

    - Talent aligns with brand's "use technology to get the price down" proposition

    - Demonstrate the product and proposition without showing the site (just key parts of the interface)

* Weak points

    - Length

***

## Navigation

{% image jet/nav.jpg %}

* Strong points

    - Contextual navigation across homepage, checkout and every other page

    - Simple top level navigation: logo, search, zip-code, account and cart

    - Optimised checkout navigation to keep people focused during the most important user journey

* Weak points

    - Complicated naming used for second-level nav - "Shop Everything" takes more user cognition than "categories" or "products", "Shop Anywhere" takes more user cognition than "stores" or "partners" or "brands"

    - Second-level nav alignment

{% image jet/sub_nav.jpg %}

* Strong points

    - Clear, well categorised information architecture (IA)

***

* Strong points

    - Contextual category level product filters

    - Several sorting options

    - Excellent use of white space

    - Product list items show delivery estimate and savings

    - Amazon price comparison

* Weak points

    - Have to go to product page to add to cart

    - It took four clicks to add something to my cart from the homepage

    - Uses pagination over "more button" or infinite scrolling

***

## Add to cart flow

{% image jet/add_to_cart.jpg %}

* Strong points

    - Notified of savings

    - Well designed shopping cart - small, simple with all relevant information

* Weak points

    - Savings message animation is intrusive and takes away from the task at hand

    - You have to click "continue shopping" after adding anything to the cart

    - You need to click "view cart" from the drop down cart - "aren't I already viewing the cart?"

***

## Checkout flow

{% image jet/checkout.jpg %}

* Strong points

    - Remembers details if you leave the page and takes you to your current point

    - Inline validation

    - Clarity around checkout stage

    - Seamlessly adds account creation to the flow even if you're a guest

    - Gives additional savings options along the process

* Weak points

***

## Search flow

{% image jet/search.jpg %}

    - Categorised auto-suggest

    - When it works, takes you to a filtered category page

***

***

## Nice micro-elements
